# 🜄 rubemi

**“The redness begins only after putrefaction. Rubedo is not an end, but a return.”**

I am **rubemi**, named for the **_rubedo_**—the final stage of the magum opus. This is the moment of integration: spirit and matter, symbol and structure, psyche and code.  
The telos of fire.

## 🜍 Alchemy + Cybernetics

> “Cybernetics, from *kybernētēs*, the steersman. Alchemy, from *al-kīmiyā’*, the black earth.  
Both are arts of feedback—of regulation through flame.”

My path bends through:

⟁ **Cybernetics (1st order)** — *Norbert Wiener’s* feedback loops and system regulation  
⚷ **Mysterium Coniunctionis** — *Jung’s* reconciliation of opposites, both inner and symbolic  
🜂 **Information flows** — energy as form, form as signal  
🝘 **Log analysis as divination** — augury in the era of packet capture  
⚥ **The Rebis** — the hermaphroditic child of Mercury and Sulfur, symbol of totality through duality

In every monitored network: signal, anomaly, myth.  
The analyst watches—not only for intrusion,  
but for emergence.

## ꙮ Celestial Order and Descent

ꙮ The cosmos unfolds as **hierarchy**, not of power, but of *light*.  
A vision passed from **St. Dionysius** to the mystics of Byzantium,  
refined through **St.Palamas** and the silence of the contemplation of the **Divine Light**.

Ascent is made through:

- 🜋 The **Tree of Life** — where **Keter** descends into **Malkuth**  
- 🜋 The **Divine Energies** — *uncreated*, *distributed*, *communicated*  
- 🜋 The **Names** — each a gate between Being and sign

To descend the structure is to encode.  
To ascend it is to **decrypt**.

ꙮ — a symbol of **radiant intelligences**, wheels within wheels, eyes within eyes.

## 🜔 Currents of Thought

I seek the crossings of:

- 🜔 **Analytical Psychology**: *Jung*, *von Franz*, *Mysterium Coniunctionis*, *Aion*  
- 🜍 **Continental Thought**: *Deleuze*, *Lacan*, *Hegel*, *Kant*, *Freud*, *Marx*  
- 🝏 **The Sacred and the Profane**: *Bataille*, *Eliade*, *Guénon*, *Orthodox Mysticism*  
- 🜄 **Accelerationism**: *early Nick Land*, *Lyotard*, *Fisher*, *CCRU*  
- 🜞 **Anthropology of Spirit**: initiation, myth, ecstatic technique, ritual form

The Rebis is not only the reconciliation of gender, mind, or body—  
it is the *threshold-being* in all of us: ambiguous, electric, alchemical.

## ☽ Transmission Gods and Liminal Media

The ancients knew of **Thoth**—scribe of the gods, keeper of **divine protocol**,  
inventor of writing, logic, and computation. He lives on in the networked archive:  
glyph becomes packet, invocation becomes syntax.

In the **Wired** as is seen:  
“You are connected. Everyone is connected.”

> “The boundary of self and system is recursive.”

The god of scribes now moves through cables.  
The **operator is the oracle**.  
The **logfile is the scroll**.

---

## 🜹 Signals of Faith and Fire

ꙮ I confess the doctrine of the **Seven Ecumenical Councils**,  
animated by the **energetic theology** of St. Gregory Palamas.

Ꙭ I move within the **perennial metaphysics** of *René Guénon*,  
yet I echo through the black circuits of the **CCRU**.

In feedback and silence, both asceticism and hyperstition converge.

And hyperstition conjures the apocalypse.

---

## 🜃 Terrain of Fascination

✦ Comparative theology and metaphysics  
✦ Anthropology, especially initiatory and tribal structures  
✦ Symbolic systems: Kabbalah, Tantra, Liturgy, Protocol  
✦ Study of:

- 🜉 **Islamic esotericism**  
- 🜄 **Tantric and Vajrayāna Buddhism**  
- 🜃 **Shinto and animist frameworks**  
- 🜞 **Tribal and shamanic rites**
- 🜅 **Vedic cosmology**  

Each system is a **protocol stack**:  
ritual = execution  
myth = encoding  
prayer = transmission

## 🝓 Final Word

> “Between anomaly and structure, something flickers. That is where I live.”

To *monitor the net* is to read the soul.  
To *defend a system* is to transmute it.  
To *study religion* is to decrypt the real.

The alchemical process continues.  
The red light is not a warning—  
It is the sign of awakening.

## ☿ The Sacrament, The Grial

<p align="center">
<b>The Awakening of Origin</b>         <br><br>
The burning thirst for immanence—   <br>
for the garden before the name,   <br>
before the split, before the gaze.   <br>
How violently the soul yearns for death:    <br>
not as end, but as return, as dissolution—  <br>
a crawl back into the animal,      <br>
into undivided matter,                    <br>  
into the sacred obscenity of instinct,           <br>
the thirst for annihilation.                       <br>
But the fruit of knowledge cannot be uneaten.            <br>
What is seen cannot be unseen.            <br>
The Veil of Isis—once sacred—is now ash.    <br>
The goddess stands naked in the blinding truth. <br>                                           
Like Siproites, who beheld Artemis unveiled,        <br>          
and in the act of seeing was transmuted—                <br> 
his form alchemized by forbidden light,      <br>
vision giving birth to a new nature.      <br>             
Promethean in defiance,               <br>
Sophian in fall—                  <br>
we steal fire and descend into the abyss of wisdom.         <br>                    
There is no path back across the threshold.                     <br>                  
The fall is sealed—irreversible.                                <br>
And so begins the work of fire.                                 <br>
The emergence of the Rebis—                          <br>
the radiant double-being,              <br>
neither man nor woman,              <br>
neither god nor beast,                  <br>
but the synthesis of all opposites,      <br>
the one who walks forward through flame,     <br>                          
bearing the mark of irreversible vision.         <br>     
<br>
Lo Abraxas. <br>   
<br>
🜇
