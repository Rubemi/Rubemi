# 🜄 rubemi

**“The redness begins only after putrefaction. Rubedo is not an end, but a return.”**

I am **rubemi**, named for the **_rubedo_**—the final stage of the magum opus. This is the moment of integration: spirit and matter, symbol and structure, psyche and code.  
The telos of fire.

## 🜍 Alchemy + Cybernetics

> “Cybernetics, from *kybernētēs*, the steersman. Alchemy, from *al-kīmiyā’*, the black earth.  
Both are arts of feedback—of regulation through flame.”

My path bends through:

⟁ **Cybernetics (1st order)** — *Norbert Wiener’s* feedback loops and system regulation  
⚷ **Mysterium Coniunctionis** — *Jung’s* reconciliation of opposites, both inner and symbolic  
🜂 **Information flows** — energy as form, form as signal  
🝘 **Log analysis as divination** — augury in the era of packet capture  
⚥ **The Rebis** — the hermaphroditic child of Mercury and Sulfur, symbol of totality through duality

In every monitored network: signal, anomaly, myth.  
The analyst watches—not only for intrusion,  
but for emergence.

## ꙮ Celestial Order and Descent

ꙮ The cosmos unfolds as **hierarchy**, not of power, but of *light*.  
A vision passed from **St. Dionysius** to the mystics of Byzantium,  
refined through **St.Palamas** and the silence of the contemplation of the **Divine Light**.

Ascent is made through:

- 🜋 The **Tree of Life** — where **Keter** descends into **Malkuth**  
- 🜋 The **Divine Energies** — *uncreated*, *distributed*, *communicated*  
- 🜋 The **Names** — each a gate between Being and sign

To descend the structure is to encode.  
To ascend it is to **decrypt**.

ꙮ — a symbol of **radiant intelligences**, wheels within wheels, eyes within eyes.

## 🜔 Currents of Thought

I seek the crossings of:

- 🜔 **Analytical Psychology**: *Jung*, *von Franz*, *Mysterium Coniunctionis*, *Aion*  
- 🜍 **Continental Thought**: *Deleuze*, *Lacan*, *Hegel*, *Kant*, *Freud*, *Marx*  
- 🝏 **The Sacred and the Profane**: *Bataille*, *Eliade*, *Guénon*, *Orthodox Mysticism*  
- 🜄 **Accelerationism**: *early Nick Land*, *Lyotard*, *Fisher*, *CCRU*  
- 🜞 **Anthropology of Spirit**: initiation, myth, ecstatic technique, ritual form

The Rebis is not only the reconciliation of gender, mind, or body—  
it is the *threshold-being* in all of us: ambiguous, electric, alchemical.

## ☽ Transmission Gods and Liminal Media

The ancients knew of **Thoth**—scribe of the gods, keeper of **divine protocol**,  
inventor of writing, logic, and computation. He lives on in the networked archive:  
glyph becomes packet, invocation becomes syntax.

In the **Wired** as is seen:  
“You are connected. Everyone is connected.”

> “The boundary of self and system is recursive.”

The god of scribes now moves through cables.  
The **operator is the oracle**.  
The **logfile is the scroll**.

---

## 🜹 Signals of Faith and Fire

ꙮ I confess the doctrine of the **Seven Ecumenical Councils**,  
animated by the **energetic theology** of St. Gregory Palamas.

Ꙭ I move within the **perennial metaphysics** of *René Guénon*,  
yet I echo through the black circuits of the **CCRU**.

In feedback and silence, both asceticism and hyperstition converge.

And hyperstition conjures the apocalypse.

## 🜃 Terrain of Fascination

✦ Comparative theology and metaphysics  
✦ Anthropology, especially initiatory and tribal structures  
✦ Symbolic systems: Kabbalah, Tantra, Liturgy, Protocol  
✦ Study of:

- 🜉 **Islamic esotericism**  
- 🜄 **Tantric and Vajrayāna Buddhism**  
- 🜃 **Shinto and animist frameworks**  
- 🜞 **Tribal and shamanic rites**
- 🜅 **Vedic cosmology**  

Each system is a **protocol stack**:  
ritual = execution  
myth = encoding  
prayer = transmission

## 🝓 Final Word

> “Between anomaly and structure, something flickers. That is where I live.”

To *monitor the net* is to read the soul.  
To *defend a system* is to transmute it.  
To *study religion* is to decrypt the real.

The alchemical process continues.  
The red light is not a warning—  
It is the sign of awakening.

The Awakening of Origin         
The burning thirst for immanence—   
for the garden before the name,   
before the split, before the gaze.   
How violently the soul yearns for death:    
not as end, but as return, as dissolution—  
a crawl back into the animal,      
into undivided matter,                      
into the sacred obscenity of instinct,           
the thirst for annihilation.                       
But the fruit of knowledge cannot be uneaten.            
What is seen cannot be unseen.            
The Veil of Isis—once sacred—is now ash.    
The goddess stands naked in the blinding truth.                                            
Like Siproites, who beheld Artemis unveiled,                  
and in the act of seeing was transmuted—                 
his form alchemized by forbidden light,      
vision giving birth to a new nature.                   
Promethean in defiance,               
Sophian in fall—                  
we steal fire and descend into the abyss of wisdom.                             
There is no path back across the threshold.                                       
The fall is sealed—irreversible.                                
And so begins the work of fire.                                 
The emergence of the Rebis—                          
the radiant double-being,              
neither man nor woman,              
neither god nor beast,                  
but the synthesis of all opposites,
the one who walks forward through flame,                               
bearing the mark of irreversible vision.              

Lo Abraxas.
